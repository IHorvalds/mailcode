A small Windows utility meant to poll mail boxes via IMAP, get emails that contain authentication codes and put them in your clipboard when you click on a notification .

# Notes
1. For GMail account, you need to enable App Passwords and create one for Mailcode to use.

2. For now, the UI is working, but the service isn't working yet. If interested, check the issues to see how much there still is to do.
